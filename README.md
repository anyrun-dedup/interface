# anyrun-interface

This crate can be used to create your own custom implementation of either plugins (if you need more freedom than
the [anyrun-plugin](https://github.com/anyrun-org/plugin) provides) or if you want to create your own runner
that uses plugins from this project.

# Usage

For usage of this crate take a look at the [main project](https://github.com/anyrun-org/anyrun) and
[the plugin crate](https://github.com/anyrun-org/plugin) for the "reference" implementation.
